= Overview =

The ubuntu-core-launcher launches snappy applications to restrict
access. It uses apparmor and seccomp to do this.

Run with:
$ ubuntu-core-launcher /path/to/rootdir security-profile /path/to/binary additional args


== Apparmor ==

The apparmor part is similar to aa-exec -p, i.e. it will launch the application
under the given apparmor profile.


== Seccomp ==

The seccomp filter profile in expected to be located in
/var/lib/snappy/seccomp/profiles

The filter file contains lines with syscall names, comments that start
with "#" or special directives that start with a "@".

The supported special directives are:
@unrestricted

The unrestricted profile looks like this:
"""
# Unrestricted profile
@unrestricted
"""

A very strict profile might look like this:
"""
# Super strict profile
read
write
"""


== devices cgroup ==

It works like this:
- on install of snaps with a special hardware: assign yaml udev rules are
  generated that add tags and properties to the matching hardware
- this launcher creates a device cgroup that is deny-all by default, then adds
  itself to the group and also adds all devices that match the given
  snap.$APPNAME tag
- the app is executed and now the normal device permissions/apparmor rules
  apply


== private /tmp ==

The launcher will create a private mount namespace for the application and
mount a per-app /tmp directory under it.


== devpts newinstance ==

The launcher will setup a new instance devpts for each application.

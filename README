= Overview =

The ubuntu-core-launcher launches snappy applications to restrict
access. It uses apparmor and seccomp to do this.

Run with:
$ ubuntu-core-launcher /path/to/rootdir /path/to/binary security-profile

== Apparmor ==

The apparmor part is similar to aa-exec -p, i.e. it will load the
given apparmor profile for the application.


== Seccomp ==

The seccomp filter profile in expected to be located in
/var/lib/snappy/seccomp/profiles

The filter file contains lines with syscall names, comments that start
with "#" or special directives that start with a "@".

The supported special directives are:
@unrestricted

The unrestricted profile looks like this:
"""
# Unrestricted profile
@unrestricted
"""

A very strict profile might look like this:
"""
# Super strict profile
read
write
"""
